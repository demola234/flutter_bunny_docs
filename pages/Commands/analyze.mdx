# Analyze Command

The `analyze` command runs static analysis on your Flutter project to identify potential issues, errors, and code style violations. It helps maintain code quality and catch problems early.

## Usage

```bash
flutter_bunny analyze [options]

```

## Options

- `-directory` or `C`: Directory to analyze (default: ".")
- `-fix` or `f`: Apply fixes to the code
- `-fatal-infos`: Treat info level issues as fatal
- `-fatal-warnings`: Treat warning level issues as fatal (default: true)

## Examples

### Run Basic Analysis

```bash
flutter_bunny analyze

```

This will run static analysis on your Flutter project and report any issues found.

### Run Analysis and Apply Fixes

```bash
flutter_bunny analyze --fix

```

This will run static analysis and attempt to automatically fix issues where possible.

### Analyze a Specific Directory

```bash
flutter_bunny analyze --directory ./packages/my_package

```

This will run analysis only on the specified directory.

### Configure Severity Levels

```bash
flutter_bunny analyze --no-fatal-warnings

```

This will prevent warning-level issues from causing the command to fail.

## Understanding the Results

The analysis results are categorized into:

- **Errors**: Critical issues that need to be fixed
- **Warnings**: Potential problems or code style violations
- **Info**: Informational issues that might be worth addressing

Example output:

```
Analysis Results:
Errors:   2
Warnings: 5
Info:     3

info • Use parameter documentation comments • lib/src/models/user.dart:15:18 • use_parameter_documentation_comments
warning • Missing parameter type • lib/src/utils/helpers.dart:22:24 • missing_parameter_type
error • The method 'doSomething' isn't defined for the class 'MyClass' • lib/src/widgets/custom_widget.dart:45:12 • undefined_method

To automatically fix some issues, try:
  flutter_bunny analyze --fix

```

## Customizing Analysis Rules

Flutter Bunny uses the standard Flutter analysis rules, but you can customize them by creating an `analysis_options.yaml` file in your project root.

Example `analysis_options.yaml`:

```yaml
include: package:lints/recommended.yaml

linter:
  rules:
    - always_declare_return_types
    - prefer_single_quotes
    - sort_child_properties_last
    - unawaited_futures
    - use_key_in_widget_constructors

analyzer:
  exclude:
    - "**/*.g.dart"
    - "**/*.freezed.dart"
  errors:
    missing_return: error
    missing_required_param: error

```

## Best Practices

1. **Run analysis regularly**: Make it part of your development workflow
2. **Fix errors immediately**: Don't let errors accumulate
3. **Review warnings**: They often indicate potential problems
4. **Use the `-fix` option**: Automatically fix common issues
5. **Customize analysis rules**: Tailor them to your project's needs
