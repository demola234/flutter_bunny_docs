# Build Command

The `build` command runs the `build_runner` tool to generate code for your Flutter project. This is particularly useful for generating code from annotations, such as JSON serialization, freezed models, or injectable dependencies.

## Usage

```bash
flutter_bunny build [options]

```

Alias: `flutter_bunny codegen [options]`

## Options

- `-watch` or `w`: Watch for file changes and rebuild as needed
- `-delete-conflicting-outputs` or `d`: Delete conflicting outputs to resolve build conflicts (default: true)
- `-directory` or `C`: Directory in which to run the build_runner (default: ".")

## Examples

### Run Build Runner Once

```bash
flutter_bunny build

```

This will run the build_runner once to generate code from annotations.

### Run Build Runner in Watch Mode

```bash
flutter_bunny build --watch

```

This will start the build_runner in watch mode, which will automatically regenerate code when files change.

### Run Build Runner with Custom Options

```bash
flutter_bunny build --delete-conflicting-outputs --directory ./packages/my_package

```

This will run the build_runner in the specified directory with the option to delete conflicting outputs.

## Common Use Cases

The `build` command is commonly used for:

1. **JSON Serialization**: With packages like `json_serializable`
2. **Immutable Models**: With packages like `freezed`
3. **Dependency Injection**: With packages like `injectable`
4. **Routing**: With packages like `auto_route`
5. **State Management**: With code generation features in packages like Bloc

## Example Workflow

1. Add annotations to your code:

```dart
// user.dart
import 'package:json_annotation/json_annotation.dart';

part 'user.g.dart';

@JsonSerializable()
class User {
  final int id;
  final String name;
  final String email;

  User({required this.id, required this.name, required this.email});

  factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$UserFromJson(json);
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => _$UserToJson(this);
}

```

1. Run the build command:

```bash
flutter_bunny build

```

1. The generated code (e.g., `user.g.dart`) will be created automatically.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the build command:

1. **Conflicting Outputs**: Use the `-delete-conflicting-outputs` flag
2. **Build Failures**: Check your annotations and dependencies
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are in your `pubspec.yaml`
4. **Path Issues**: Use the `-directory` option to specify the correct path
