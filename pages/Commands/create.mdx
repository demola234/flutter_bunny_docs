# Create Command

The `create` command allows you to generate a new Flutter application interactively or with specific options. It guides you through selecting your project's architecture, state management solution, and more.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  The create command is typically the first command you'll use with Flutter Bunny CLI. It sets up your project with a consistent structure based on your chosen architecture.
</Callout>

## Usage

```bash
# Create a new Flutter application interactively
flutter_bunny create app

# Create with specific options
flutter_bunny create app --name my_awesome_app --architecture clean_architecture --state-management riverpod
```

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--name` | The name of the project | Interactive prompt |
| `--architecture` | Architecture pattern (clean_architecture, mvvm, mvc) | From config or interactive prompt |
| `--state-management` | State management solution | From config or interactive prompt |
| `--features` | Features you would like to include on your project | Authentication, User Profile, Settings |
| `--modules` | Modules you'd like to include on your project | Network Layer, Localization, Push Notifications |


## Interactive Creation Process

When running `flutter_bunny create app` without options, you'll be guided through an interactive process:

## State Management Options

Flutter Bunny supports multiple state management solutions:

- **Provider** - Simple and flexible state management
- **Riverpod** - Evolution of Provider with improved patterns
- **Bloc/Cubit** - Predictable state management with events and states
- **GetX** - Lightweight state management with utilities
- **MobX** - Reactive state management
- **Redux** - Predictable state container

## Examples

### Create a New App Interactively

```bash
flutter_bunny create app
```

This will start an interactive CLI where you can configure your project step by step.

### Create a New App with Specified Options

```bash
flutter_bunny create app --name shopping_app --architecture clean_architecture --state-management bloc
```

This creates a new Flutter application named "shopping_app" with Clean Architecture and the BLoC state management pattern.

### Create an App with Custom Organization

```bash
flutter_bunny create app --name travel_app --org com.mycompany.travel
```

This creates a new Flutter application with the bundle ID "com.mycompany.travel.travel_app".

## Next Steps

After creating your application, you might want to:

1. [Generate components](/commands/generate) with the `generate` command
2. [Configure your project settings](/commands/config) with the `config` command
3. [Run static analysis](/commands/analyze) with the `analyze` command
