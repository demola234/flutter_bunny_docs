# Doctor Command

The `doctor` command checks the health of your Flutter project and identifies common issues. It can also fix some problems automatically. This command helps ensure your project follows best practices and is properly configured.

## Usage

```bash
flutter_bunny doctor [options]

```

## Options

- `-directory` or `C`: Directory to check (default: ".")
- `-project-only`: Only check project-specific issues, not Flutter SDK
- `-fix` or `f`: Attempt to fix issues automatically

## Examples

### Check Project Health

```bash
flutter_bunny doctor

```

This will check your Flutter project for common issues and the Flutter environment.

### Check Project Only

```bash
flutter_bunny doctor --project-only

```

This will only check project-specific issues, skipping the Flutter SDK check.

### Check and Fix Issues

```bash
flutter_bunny doctor --fix

```

This will check your project and attempt to automatically fix any identified issues.

### Check a Specific Directory

```bash
flutter_bunny doctor --directory ./packages/my_package

```

This will check the specified directory for issues.

## What Doctor Checks

The `doctor` command checks for various issues, including:

### Flutter Environment

- Flutter SDK installation and version
- Development tools (Android Studio, Xcode, etc.)
- Connected devices
- Dependencies and plugins

### Project Structure

- Required files (`pubspec.yaml`, etc.)
- Proper directory structure
- Configuration files (analysis_options.yaml, etc.)
- Test directory setup

### Dependencies

- Up-to-date dependencies
- Pubspec.lock consistency
- Conflicting dependencies

### Best Practices

- Gitignore configuration
- README and documentation
- License files
- Project organization

## Fixing Issues

When run with the `--fix` flag, the doctor command can automatically fix several issues:

- Generate missing configuration files
- Update outdated dependencies
- Create template files for tests
- Set up proper .gitignore
- Initialize missing directories

Checking project health...
Found 3 issues with your project

Project Health Check Results:
1. Missing analysis_options.yaml
   No analysis_options.yaml file found. This file helps maintain code quality.
   This issue can be fixed automatically with --fix
   Recommendations:
   - Create an analysis_options.yaml file with appropriate lints
   - Consider using package:lints/recommended.yaml as a base

2. Empty test directory
   The test directory exists but contains no tests.
   Recommendations:
   - Add unit, widget, and integration tests to your project
   - Run "flutter test" to execute your tests

3. Minimal lib directory structure
   The lib directory has minimal structure. Consider organizing your code better.
   Recommendations:
   - Create subdirectories for different parts of your app (widgets, screens, models, etc.)
   - Separate business logic from UI code

```

## Best Practices

1. **Run doctor regularly**: Make it part of your development workflow
2. **Fix critical issues first**: Focus on errors before warnings
3. **Use the `-fix` option**: Let the tool fix common issues automatically
4. **Follow recommendations**: Implement suggested changes for best practices
5. **Run before releases**: Ensure your project is healthy before distribution
