# Update Command

The `update` command allows you to update the Flutter Bunny CLI to the latest version. It checks for updates and installs them if available.

## Usage

```bash
flutter_bunny update [options]

```

## Options

- `-force` or `f`: Force update even if the CLI tool is up to date

## Examples

### Check for Updates and Install if Available

```bash
flutter_bunny update

```

This will check if there's a newer version available and update if necessary.

### Force Update

```bash
flutter_bunny update --force

```

This will update the CLI tool even if it's already at the latest version.

## How It Works

The update command performs the following steps:

1. Checks the current installed version
2. Queries the Dart pub.dev repository for the latest version
3. Compares versions to determine if an update is needed
4. Downloads and installs the latest version if necessary
5. Verifies the installation was successful

## Example Output

If already up to date:

```
Flutter Bunny is already at the latest version: 1.0.-beta.9

```

If an update is available:

```
Updating Flutter Bunny from 1.0.7-beta.9 to 1.0.7-beta.3...
Flutter Bunny updated to 1.0.7-beta.3

âœ“ Update successful!

To verify the update, run:
  flutter_bunny --version

```

## Update Channels

Flutter Bunny may have different release channels:

- **Stable**: Well-tested releases for production use
- **Beta**: Preview releases with new features
- **Dev**: Development versions for testing

By default, the update command uses the same channel as your current installation.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the update command:

### Permission Errors

If you see permission errors, you may need to run with sudo or fix your directory permissions:

```bash
sudo flutter_bunny update

```

### Network Issues

If you can't connect to pub.dev, check your internet connection or proxy settings.

### Version Verification

If the update seems to have completed but the version hasn't changed:

1. Run `flutter_bunny --version` to verify
2. Check your PATH to ensure you're running the updated version
3. Try running `pub global activate flutter_bunny` manually

## Best Practices

1. **Regular updates**: Keep Flutter Bunny up to date for the latest features and fixes
2. **Backup projects**: Before updating to a major version, back up your projects
3. **Read release notes**: Check the changelog for breaking changes
4. **Check compatibility**: Ensure the new version works with your Flutter version

## Automatic Update Checks

Flutter Bunny automatically checks for updates periodically when you run commands. If an update is available, you'll see a notification:

```
A new version of Flutter Bunny is available: 1.0.7-beta.3 (current: 1.0.7-beta.3)
Run 'flutter_bunny update' to get the latest version.
