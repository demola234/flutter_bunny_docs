# About Flutter Bunny CLI

Flutter Bunny CLI is a tool designed to streamline Flutter application development by providing an opinionated approach to project structure, architecture, and code generation.

## The Story Behind Flutter Bunny CLI

Flutter Bunny CLI was created to solve common challenges in Flutter development:

1. **Inconsistent Project Structure**: Every developer had a different way of organizing their Flutter projects
2. **Boilerplate Code**: Flutter development often requires writing repetitive boilerplate code
3. **Architecture Decisions**: Many teams struggle with choosing and implementing an architecture pattern
4. **Maintenance Overhead**: As projects grow, maintaining a clean and consistent codebase becomes challenging
5. **Increase Productivity**: Developers should spend less time on setup and more time on building features

The goal was to create a tool that would provide sensible defaults and best practices while still allowing flexibility for customization.

## Core Principles

Flutter Bunny CLI is built on these core principles:
### 1. Convention Over Configuration

We provide sensible defaults so you can focus on building features rather than deciding on folder structures and patterns.

### 2. Best Practices First

All templates and generated code follow Flutter best practices, ensuring your project starts with a solid foundation.

### 3. Flexibility

While opinionated, Flutter Bunny CLI allows for customization to match your team's specific needs.

### 4. Developer Experience

The CLI is designed to be intuitive and helpful, with clear error messages and guidance.

## Project Status

Flutter Bunny CLI is currently in beta. We're actively developing new features and improvements while maintaining a stable core that's ready for everyday use.

## Roadmap

Our roadmap includes:

- **Template Marketplace**: A platform for sharing and discovering custom templates
- **Plugin System**: Extend Flutter Bunny CLI with plugins
- **Web UI**: A web interface for managing your projects
- **More Architecture Patterns**: Support for additional architecture patterns
