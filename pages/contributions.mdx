## Development Workflow

### Creating a New Feature

1. Create a new branch from `main`

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

    ```

2. Implement your feature or fix a bug
3. Write tests for your changes
4. Run tests to ensure everything works

    ```bash
    dart test

    ```

5. Format your code

    ```bash
    dart format .

    ```

6. Run the analyzer

    ```bash
    dart analyze

    ```

7. Commit your changes

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add your descriptive commit message"

    ```

8. Push to your fork

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name

    ```

9. Create a Pull Request on GitHub

### Implementing a New Command

To implement a new command for Flutter Bunny:

1. Create a new file in `lib/src/commands/` for your command
2. Extend the `Command<int>` class from `args` package
3. Implement the required methods
4. Register your command in `lib/src/commands/flutter_bunny_runner.dart`

Example command implementation:

```dart
import 'package:args/command_runner.dart';
import 'package:mason_logger/mason_logger.dart';

class MyNewCommand extends Command<int> {
  MyNewCommand({
    required Logger logger,
  }) : _logger = logger {
    // Define arguments and flags
    argParser
      ..addOption(
        'option-name',
        help: 'Description of the option',
        defaultsTo: 'default-value',
      )
      ..addFlag(
        'flag-name',
        help: 'Description of the flag',
        negatable: false,
      );
  }

  final Logger _logger;

  @override
  String get description => 'Description of your command';

  @override
  String get name => 'command-name';

  @override
  Future<int> run() async {
    // Implement your command logic
    final optionValue = argResults?['option-name'] as String;
    final flagValue = argResults?['flag-name'] as bool;

    _logger.info('Running command with option: $optionValue and flag: $flagValue');

    // Do something...

    return ExitCode.success.code;
  }
}

```

### Adding Templates

To add new templates:

1. Create template files in `lib/src/templates/`
2. Use variables with double curly braces: `{{variable_name}}`
3. Register the template in the appropriate generator

### Testing

We use the `test` package for testing. Please ensure all new features or bug fixes have corresponding tests.

To run tests:

```bash
dart test

```

To run a specific test:

```bash
dart test test/commands/create_command_test.dart

```

## Code Style

Please follow the Dart style guide and use the Dart formatter:

```bash
dart format .

```
