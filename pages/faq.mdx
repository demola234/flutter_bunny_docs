## Troubleshooting

### The `flutter_bunny` command is not found

Make sure the Dart pub global bin directory is in your PATH. See the installation section above.

### Error: "Could not find a file named 'pubspec.yaml'"

This error occurs when running a Flutter Bunny command in a directory that isn't a Flutter project. Make sure you're in the root directory of your Flutter project.

### Build command is failing

If the `build` command is failing, try:

1. Checking if build_runner is in your dependencies
2. Using the `-delete-conflicting-outputs` flag
3. Making sure your annotations are correct

### Generate command creates files in the wrong location

This might happen if your project structure doesn't match what Flutter Bunny expects. You can customize the output paths in your configuration:

```bash
flutter_bunny config set generate.output_paths.screens "lib/ui/screens"

```
