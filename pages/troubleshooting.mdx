# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you solve common issues you might encounter when using Flutter Bunny CLI.

## Installation Issues

### Command Not Found

**Problem**: After installation, `flutter_bunny` command is not found.

**Solution**:
1. Make sure the Dart pub cache bin directory is in your PATH:

   **Windows**:
   ```
   %APPDATA%\Pub\Cache\bin
   ```

   **macOS/Linux**:
   ```
   export PATH="$PATH":"$HOME/.pub-cache/bin"
   ```

2. Verify installation was successful:
   ```bash
   dart pub global list | grep flutter_bunny
   ```

3. Try reinstalling:
   ```bash
   dart pub global activate flutter_bunny
   ```

### Permission Denied

**Problem**: Permission denied error when running Flutter Bunny CLI.

**Solution**:

**macOS/Linux**:
```bash
# Change permissions
chmod +x $HOME/.pub-cache/bin/flutter_bunny

# Or run with sudo (not recommended for regular use)
sudo flutter_bunny <command>
```

**Windows**: Run Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator.

## Create Command Issues

### Project Creation Fails

**Problem**: `flutter_bunny create app` fails with errors.

**Solution**:
1. Check if Flutter is properly installed:
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```

2. Try with verbose logging:
   ```bash
   flutter_bunny create app --verbose
   ```

3. Make sure you have write permissions in the current directory.

### Invalid Project Name

**Problem**: Error about invalid project name.

**Solution**:
Use a name that follows Dart package naming conventions:
- Lowercase letters
- Underscores for spaces
- No special characters

```bash
# Good
flutter_bunny create app --name my_app

# Bad (don't use these)
flutter_bunny create app --name MyApp
flutter_bunny create app --name "My App"
flutter_bunny create app --name my-app
```

## Generate Command Issues

### Generated Files in Wrong Location

**Problem**: Generated files are created in the wrong directory.

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you're running the command from the project root.

2. Check if your project follows the expected structure for the architecture you're using.

3. Configure custom output paths:
   ```bash
   flutter_bunny config set generate.output_paths.screens "lib/ui/screens"
   flutter_bunny config set generate.output_paths.widgets "lib/ui/widgets"
   flutter_bunny config set generate.output_paths.models "lib/data/models"
   ```

### Invalid Parameters Format

**Problem**: Error when using `--params` or `--fields` flags.

**Solution**:
Make sure you're using the correct format:
- Use quotes around the entire string
- Use `name:Type` format
- Separate multiple parameters with commas
- No spaces around colons or commas

```bash
# Correct
flutter_bunny generate model --name User --fields "id:int,name:String,email:String"

# Incorrect
flutter_bunny generate model --name User --fields id:int, name:String, email:String
```

## Build Command Issues

### build_runner Not Found

**Problem**: Error that build_runner is not found.

**Solution**:
1. Make sure build_runner is in your pubspec.yaml:
   ```yaml
   dev_dependencies:
     build_runner: ^2.3.0
   ```

2. Run Flutter pub get:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

### Conflicting Outputs

**Problem**: build_runner fails due to conflicting outputs.

**Solution**:
Use the `--delete-conflicting-outputs` flag:
```bash
flutter_bunny build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Analyzer Errors Preventing Build

**Problem**: Analyzer errors prevent build_runner from completing.

**Solution**:
1. Fix the analyzer errors first:
   ```bash
   flutter_bunny analyze --fix
   ```

2. Then run the build command again.

## Analyze Command Issues

### Too Many Errors

**Problem**: Analyzer shows too many errors, making it hard to focus.

**Solution**:
Fix errors incrementally:
1. Start with fatal errors:
   ```bash
   flutter_bunny analyze --no-fatal-warnings --no-fatal-infos
   ```

2. Then handle warnings:
   ```bash
   flutter_bunny analyze --no-fatal-infos
   ```

3. Finally, handle info messages:
   ```bash
   flutter_bunny analyze
   ```

## Doctor Command Issues

### False Positives

**Problem**: Doctor reports issues that are actually intentional or not relevant.

**Solution**:
1. Run with project-only flag to focus on your project issues:
   ```bash
   flutter_bunny doctor --project-only
   ```

2. Create a custom configuration for doctor checks:
   ```bash
   flutter_bunny config set doctor.checks.readme false
   ```

## Config Command Issues

### Config Not Persisting

**Problem**: Configuration changes don't seem to persist between runs.

**Solution**:
1. Check if you have write permissions to the config directory:
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   ls -la ~/.flutter_bunny/

   # Windows
   dir %USERPROFILE%\.flutter_bunny
   ```

2. Try running with administrator privileges (Windows) or sudo (macOS/Linux).

3. Manually edit the config file (as a last resort):
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   nano ~/.flutter_bunny/config.yaml

   # Windows
   notepad %USERPROFILE%\.flutter_bunny\config.yaml
   ```

## Update Command Issues

### Update Fails

**Problem**: `flutter_bunny update` command fails.

**Solution**:
1. Try with force flag:
   ```bash
   flutter_bunny update --force
   ```

2. Uninstall and reinstall:
   ```bash
   dart pub global deactivate flutter_bunny
   dart pub global activate flutter_bunny
   ```

## Template Issues

### Custom Templates Not Working

**Problem**: Custom templates are not being used.

**Solution**:
1. Check your template directory structure:
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   ls -la ~/.flutter_bunny/templates/

   # Windows
   dir %USERPROFILE%\.flutter_bunny\templates
   ```

2. Make sure template syntax is correct.

3. Make sure you're referencing the template correctly:
   ```bash
   flutter_bunny create app --template my_custom_template
   ```

## Dependency Issues

### Version Conflicts

**Problem**: Dependency version conflicts.

**Solution**:
1. Check your Flutter version compatibility:
   ```bash
   flutter --version
   ```

2. Try updating Flutter:
   ```bash
   flutter upgrade
   ```

3. Run Flutter doctor to check for issues:
   ```bash
   flutter doctor -v
   ```

## Performance Issues

### Commands Running Slowly

**Problem**: Flutter Bunny CLI commands are running slowly.

**Solution**:
1. Check your system resources (CPU, RAM, disk space).

2. Try clearing Flutter's cache:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   ```

3. Try clearing Dart's pub cache (use with caution):
   ```bash
   dart pub cache clean
   ```

## Debugging

### Enable Verbose Logging

For detailed logs to help troubleshoot:

```bash
flutter_bunny --verbose <command>
```

### Check Environment

To view your environment:

```bash
flutter_bunny doctor
flutter --version
dart --version
```

### Check Logs

**macOS/Linux**:
```bash
cat ~/.flutter_bunny/logs/flutter_bunny.log
```

**Windows**:
```bash
type %USERPROFILE%\.flutter_bunny\logs\flutter_bunny.log
```
